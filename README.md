DetailedBatteryUsage
====================

For those times when a simple percentage isn't enough

This unlocks the hidden battery usage menu Apple uses internally during development (found in Settings->General->Usage->Battery Usage)

At the bottom there's an option to show/hide daemons from the list. The "Save For Demo" button generates a plist representation of the data and stores in "/var/mobile/Library/Logs/BatteryUIDemos"
